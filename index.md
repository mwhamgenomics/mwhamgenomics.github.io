Hello and welcome to {{ site.title | safe }}, a combined technical blog on programming, bioinformatics and music.

In the course of my job as a bioinformatician and software developer, I often encounter periods of head-scratching, trying to solve a problem or get something to work. Previously I would just find a solution and move on, only to come across the same problem again months later. Hopefully this website will help rectify that so that I (and hopefully others) won't have to puzzle over the same problem over and over.

Since I work for a genomics institute, most of the programming I do is to solve problems that are biological at heart. Bioinformatics and computational biology is constantly evolving, always faced with some degree of uncertainty, and involves complex processing of huge quantities of input data. Documented here are some of my experiences in bioinformatics, tools that I've used, and problems that I've encountered and attempted to solve.

Finally, in deference to my main spare-time interest, there are also some posts here relating to music - harmonic theory, chord extensions, and similar.

Hope you find this site useful.

### About me

- I am a biologist by qualification, programmer by occupation and musician by night.
- I'm on GitHub [here](https://github.com/mwhamgenomics).
- I post things here semi-regularly, usually after particularly painful technical adventures.
