Hello, and welcome to mwhamgenomics.github.io.

Here, you'll find posts on a mix of topics. The first of these (and probably the one that will accumulate the most posts) is various aspects of software and computer programming. During the course of my job as a software developer, I often encounter long periods of head-scratching, trying to solve a problem or getting something to work. Having found a solution, I usually then proceed to implement it and move on, only to come across the problem again and spend time trying to remember how I last solved it. Hopefully, this website will be a useful reference to me and to others encountering the same problems.

The second topic of this site is bioinformatics. As seen in my [GitHub profile]({{ site.github_username | prepend: "https://www.github.com/"}}), I work for a genomics institute, so most of the work I do is to solve problems are biological at heart. Bioinformatics has been around for a while, but is constantly changing and is always faced with some degree of uncertainty. There are usually many processing stages involved in converting raw biological data into useful information, and the quantities of data involved can be huge. Documented here are my experiences in bioinformatics, tools that I've used, and problems that I've encountered and attempted to solve.

Finally, in deference to my main spare-time interest, there will be some posts relating to music theory. Chord extensions, jazz contrafactions, famous and important musicians, and similar.

Hope you find this site useful.

I am a biologist by qualification, developer by occupation and musician by night. Most of the software projects I'm involved in can be found on GitHub.
