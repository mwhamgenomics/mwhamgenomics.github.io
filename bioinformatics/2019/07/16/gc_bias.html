<h2>Estimating GC bias in short-read WGS data</h2>

<p>16 Jul 2019</p>



<p>Category: <a href="/bioinformatics">bioinformatics</a></p>




<p>A while ago at Edinburgh Genomics, we saw a phenomenon where some of the data we produced had significant
inconsistency of coverage in genomic regions with high GC content. At the time, we only noticed it after we had
finished generating the data, and it would have helped to have had an earlier warning of this so we could stop and
resequence the sample. To this end, we implemented a GC bias estimate in our data processing.</p>
<h2>GC bias</h2>
<p>In most forms of whole genome sequencing we read the genome multiple times, giving us a coverage value for each
base. If a sample has been sequenced to 30X coverage, each base has been read on average about 30 times. If you
sequence a base at a given position 30 times and get an 'A' most times, then you can be pretty sure it's an 'A'.
Ideally, we would sequence the whole genome to the same coverage all the way across, but due to the stochastic
nature of the sequencing process, coverage is rarely completely even across the genome. On top of this natural
randomness, coverage can in some cases be diminished in certain genomic regions such as those with extremes of GC
content, which can affect analysis of quantitative features like copy number variation, but also basic variant
detection.</p>
<p>A major source of GC bias in WGS library preparation is PCR amplification, which is a very useful technique for
obtaining sequenceable DNA from small samples, but is also infamous among students, postdocs and professors alike
for going wrong in a variety of ways, including inferior amplification of DNA fragments with particularly high or
low GC content. If the sequence or GC content of the DNA fragments are known, it is possible to use additives
and/or tune the PCR thermal cycling accordingly, but this is not possible in short-read sequencing where these are
not known. As a result, the performance of the amplification is skewed by the different annealing temperatures of
AT- and GC-rich DNA, and the tendency of GC-rich DNA to form stem loops. PCR-free library preparation has been
seen to improve downstream processing of samples with high GC content.</p>
<p>In reality there is always some GC bias even in good short-read data, but here we were observing drops in coverage
even in areas of moderately high GC for some library preps. For an example, see the plots below, generated from
<a href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#CollectGcBiasMetrics">picardtools</a>:</p>
<div class="container" style="margin: 0; width: 100%;">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <img class="jpeg" src="/img/non_biased_coverage.jpg" alt="non_biased_coverage" />
            <small>Non GC-biased</small>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <img class="jpeg" src="/img/biased_coverage.jpg" alt="biased_coverage" />
            <small>GC-biased</small>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Here, coverage metrics are collected for areas along the sequenced genome and grouped by GC content bins, i.e.
areas that are 0% GC, 1% GC, 2% GC, etc. all the way up to 100%. What distinguishes the GC-biased sample here is
the drop-off in normalised coverage (the blue series) between 20% and 80% GC, which is otherwise relatively level
in non-biased samples.</p>
<p>So to check for GC bias, we could generate one of these plots for each sample we sequence and look at it. However,
this would not be an appropriate solution for us due to the large numbers of samples we process, so a better
solution would be to extract a simple metric from the graph, apply a threshold to it and programatically flag up
any samples that exceed it.</p>
<h2>Theil-Sen estimation</h2>
<p>The first metric we calculated was the mathematical equivalent of what we had been doing before, i.e. looking at
the graph and checking whether coverage drops off at higher GC content. This would involve drawing a line of best
through the data points and measuring its gradient. To do this, we used
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theil-Sen_estimator">Theil-Sen estimation</a>, which is implemented in
<a href="https://scipy.org/">SciPy</a>. This algorithm essentially draws a line of best fit (shown below in red) through the
input data points and returns a slope/gradient value:</p>
<p><img class="jpeg jpeg_small" src="/img/theil_sen.jpg" alt="theil_sen" />
<br/>
<small>Theil-Sen estimation</small></p>
<p>If this value is sufficiently low or high (i.e. the line is steep enough), then we can interpret this as
significant GC bias. We filtered the data points used in this estimation to only those between 20% and 80% GC,
both because of the large amount of noise in the data outside this region skewing the metric, and because there is
a precedence for this practice in the form of
<a href="https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/computeGCBias.html">deeptools computeGCBias</a>.</p>
<h2>Deviation from normal</h2>
<p>This is not a commonly-used statistical test as far as I am aware, but we decided to try it alongside Theil-Sen
estimation to see if it was also an effective measurement. For each data point, we subtracted the normal from the
absolute of the coverage value, which is effectively the equivalent of taking a ruler and measuring the distance
on the graph between the data point and the normal - again shown below in red:</p>
<p><img class="jpeg jpeg_small" src="/img/normal_deviation.jpg" alt="normal_deviation" />
<br/>
<small>Normal deviation</small></p>
<p>This gives us a set of deviation values, which we can then take an average of. We did however use a different way
of filtering which data points to use. In Theil-Sen, we simply took all data points between 20% GC and 80% GC
whereas here, we used the 'windows' value for each data point, visible on the graphs above as the red series - if
the number of windows for a data point accounted for more than a certain fraction <code>1/n</code> of the total windows in the
dataset, then it was included. The number <code>n</code> was calibrated to filter to a similar number of data points as when
performing simple filtering between 20% GC and 80% GC, and we arrived at a number of 2500.</p>
<h2>Test data</h2>
<p>We had a test set of 40 samples, 10 of which we knew from downstream analysis to be GC-biased. We were able to
implement the core logic of our GC bias checks as below:</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Running the above algorithms on our 40 samples gave the following violin plots:</p>
<p><img class="jpeg" src="/img/comparison.jpg" alt="comparison" />
<br/>
<small>Violin plots of both metrics discussed above, for known biased/unbiased samples</small></p>
<p>For both metrics, biased samples are clearly separated from non-biased, differing by an order of magnitude. This
shows that 1) it is possible to distinguish GC-biased from non GC-biased samples with a single metric, and 2) the
deviation from normal is equally as effective a metric as Theil-Sen estimation.</p>
<p>The two metrics use different ways of filtering which data points to use. Filtering on GC content between 20% and
80% is consistent with the way other tools like
<a href="https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/computeGCBias.html">deeptools computeGCBias</a> filter
data, whereas filtering on number of windows filters out noise in a way that's more agnostic of what the extremes
are.</p>
<p>In reality, we use both of these metrics and rather than being a definite indicator of GC bias in a single sample,
we intend to use them to identify trends in batches of samples processed together. For example, if many samples
are prepared for sequencing together and all show different slopes or normal deviations, it is possible that there
was a problem with the library preparation.</p>
<p>Having found a way of reporting on GC bias in samples, the next step is to find a way of comparing all samples in
a library preparation plate, which our system is not currently optimised for. Once we have made this possible
though, we will be able to detect biased library preparation in a sequencing batch, allowing us to repeat the
preparation and sequencing in order to produce better data.</p>
