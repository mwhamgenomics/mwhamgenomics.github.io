About a year and a half ago I was at a workshop where a colleague (of sorts) was presenting some work he'd done on a
game called the Prisoner's Dilemma. Explained briefly, the Prisoner's Dilemma is a simple turn-based game for two
players. A player can either cooperate or defect, and will score differently depending on what they and their opponent
do - if your opponent cooperates and you defect, you get a lot of points. There is an online community of people who
develop strategies to play off against others, and my colleague was able to use evolutionary biology to develop the best
strategy yet for this game.

This post will cover similar ground in that we will use evolutionary biology to play a game, however instead of the
Prisoner's Dilemma, we will be playing Super Mario World.
