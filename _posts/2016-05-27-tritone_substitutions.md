Imagine you are listening to a guitarist and a bass player accompanying a soloist on an F blues. The guitarist, in a typical Freddie Green style, plays four block chords to the bar, using mainly the Third and Seventh of the present chord - in this case, an A and an Eb for the first four bars of F7, before moving to an Ab and a D when the chord moves to Bb. Meanwhile the bass player 'walks', i.e. improvises a low background countermelody to fit the chords. For example:

     F7                                  Bb7
    |F A Bb B|C A Bb B|C D Eb E|F G Ab A|Bb...

The bass walks between the F and C (the Root and the Fifth) on the first beat of each bar, arriving at a Bb to mark the first bar of chord IV in the F blues progression, Bb7. This combination of walking bass and Third/Seventh block chords is central to the familiar Jazz sound.

However, you notice that sometimes the bass player plays something slightly different on the last bar before moving to chord IV. He plays:

     F7                                  Bb7
    |F A Bb B|C A Bb B|C D Eb E|F G Ab B|Bb...

Instead of leading up to the first bar of chord IV - A to Bb - he leads down from B to Bb. This changes the feel of the progression and adds suspense before resolving into the next chord. The band has just played a tritone substitution.

The tritone substitution has an interesting sound and a very interesting and useful underlying theory. It revolves around the idea that two dominant seventh chords six semitones (i.e. a tritone) apart can be effectively interchanged, especially with respect to the Thirds and Sevenths that the guitarist is dutifully chunking out. The tritone substitution in the above scenario trades an F7 for a B7. The notes F and B are a tritone apart, and the chords F7 and B7 both have A and Eb as their Thirds and Sevenths (albeit swapped around). This has some exciting implications for the bass player, who now has the power to completely change the underlying chord with just one note. With the guitarist playing an A and Eb, the bass player can play an F to create an F7 chord, or a B to create a B7 chord.

As before, the Fifth is equally as capable of this as the Root. Consider the following possible bass line:

     F7                         (B7/5)      Bb7
    |F A Bb B|C D Eb E|F A Ab G|F# F# F# F#|F...

This has some interesting implications. In the fourth bar, instead of an F7 with a Root bass note (F A Eb), the band is now playing a B7 with a Fifth bass note (F# A Eb), which is just a C away from a diminished chord or a Db away from a 7b5 chord. This way of fiddling around with chord sequences is popular with solo instrumentalists and organ players, where the player has full control over both the bass and the chords.

Of course tritone substitutions don't have to be spontaneous - they are written in to many standards. Take Charlie Parker's Blues for Alice:

    | F     | Em7b5  A7  | Dm7 G7  | Cm7  F7  |
    | Bb7   | Bbm7   Eb7 | Am7 D7  | Abm7 Db7 |
    | Gm7   | C7         | F   Dm7 | Gm7  C7  ||

Bars 6-8 have a downward chromatic progression in fourths - Bb to Eb, A to D and Ab to Db. However, this also results in a series of overlapping tritone substitutions. The Bbm7 and Eb7 in bar 6 lead you to expect it to resolve to Ab7 in bar 7, as per a II-V-I turnaround. Instead, however, it goes to D7, which has the same Third and Seventh (F# and C), via an Am7 passing chord. The same thing happens in bars 7-8, going from Am7 and D7 to Db7 via Abm7. As an added bonus, if you play the Thirds and Sevenths, you get a nice downward chromatic progression:

      Bbm7   Eb7    Am7  D7     Abm7  Db7   Gm7
    | Db/Ab  Db/G | C/G  C/F# | B/F#  F/B | F/Bb ...

Overall, tritone substitutions are useful in any form of modern popular or classical music. Written or ad-lib, they help lift the harmony of the music, allowing the musician to add suspense and unpredictability to the listener's experience.
